# IM-faults-detection
# Introduction
### Detecting the faults of induction motor using [CNN-1D] and [DeepConvLSTM]

The Dataset is referenced in the study: A deep learning method for motor fault diagnosis based on a capsule network with gate-structure delated convolutions


# Usage
Run cnn.ipynb and cnn_lstm.ipynb to train the models
Run data.ipynb to visualize the dataset
